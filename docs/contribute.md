# How to Contribute

So, you want to help? Awesome! In order to guide this the best way we can and to make sure we can help you in either getting a bug fixed or improve our documentation, we are giving you an issue template that should be used. With this issue template, we can make sure we have all the information needed to move on.

## Expectations
Even though this is an Open project, it does not mean that we have 24/7 support for it. The best way to make sure that we accept your bugfix or add in a feature you want is still to make a pull request and link it in the issue. Include some reasons how to reproduce or even better, make sure the bug is tested and passes highy increases your chances for the change to get committed.

So, you've done all that? It very likely that it could get committed really quickly but since some of the contributers to this project could be on a holiday or we are in no way responsible in actually merging it in soon. But have no fear! Since you filed a pull request from your fork, you are able to use a version of moonshot yourselves. And we promise you, we will do our utter best!
